#  ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ  #

**ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ** is an RDF graph library written in Literate
  CoffeeScript and licensed under the GNU GPLv3.
This file will serve as your introduction to the source code, and
  provide information on the project in general.

ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ targets browsers‚Äîmore or less.
It will interpret `self` or `window` as the "global object" if it
  exists; otherwise it will assign to `exports` for CommonJS requires.
Please try to ensure that one of these objects exists in your
  environment _before_ running this code‚Äîotherwise, nothing will
  happen!

    global = self ? window ? exports
    throw new ReferenceError "Unknown global object." unless global

##  Required Constructors  ##

Many ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ functions can only be called as constructors.
The `construct«É` function makes checking for this easy.

    construct«É = (context, constructor, type) ->
      throw new TypeError "
        #{type} must be called as a constructor.
      " unless context?
      throw new TypeError "
        This is not a #{type}.
      " unless context instanceof constructor

##  Uncallable Constructors  ##

To save space, the generator function `√ò` is defined for generating
  uncallable constructors whenever they are needed in the code.
`√ò` takes as its arguments an `identifier`, which will be inferred as
  the function name (not actually in ES 5.1, but potentially in later
  versions), and `‚Ñô`, which is the (real) prototype for the fake
  constructor.

    √ò = (identifier = "anonymous", ‚Ñô = Object::) ->
      obj = [identifier]: -> throw new TypeError "Illegal constructor."
      Object.defineProperty obj[identifier], "prototype",
        configurable: no
        value: ‚Ñô
        writable: no

##  Using ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ  ##

All ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ constants, objects, and constructors are made
available through the `ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ` object.
The `ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ` object is technically an instance of
`Ôº≠ÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ`‚Äîbut this constructor doesn't do anything and can't
actually be called.

    Object.defineProperty (Ôº≠ÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ = ->)::, "constructor",
      configurable: no
      value: √ò "Ôº≠ÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ", Ôº≠ÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ::
      writable: no
    ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ = new Ôº≠ÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ

ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ targets vanilla ES 5.1, so it doesn't use modules or
  similar.
It simply attaches itself to the global object at `"ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ"`.
For the adventurous, you can also access the ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ object from
  the emoji sequence `"üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåä"`.
Nongendered merpeople are allowed too!

    SIGIL = do ->
      MALE = "\u2642"
      MERPERSON = "\u{1F9DC}"
      FEMALE = "\u2640"
      VS16 = "\uFE0F"
      WAVE = "\u{1F30A}"
      ZWJ = "\u200D"
      Object.defineProperties global,
        ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ:
          configurable: yes
          value: ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ
        "#{MERPERSON}#{WAVE}":
          configurable: yes
          value: ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ
        "#{MERPERSON}#{ZWJ}#{FEMALE}#{VS16}#{WAVE}":
          configurable: yes
          value: ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ
        "#{MERPERSON}#{ZWJ}#{MALE}#{VS16}#{WAVE}":
          configurable: no
          value: null  #  No boys allowed!!
      return "#{MERPERSON}#{WAVE}"

##  Identity Information  ##

The global `ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ` object identifies itself using a number of
  properties, so that you can easily tell which version you are using
  (and so that you can build tools which support multiple versions!)

    Object.defineProperties ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ,

The `‚Ñπ` property provides an identifying URI for the API author of this
  version of ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ.
If you fork ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ and change its API, you should also change
  this value.

      ‚Ñπ: value: "https://go.KIBI.family/mermaid/"

The `N¬∫` property provides the version number of this version of
  ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ, as an object with three parts: `major`, `minor`, and
  `patch`.
It is up to the API author (identified above) to determine how these
  parts should be interpreted.
It is recommended that the `toString()` and `valueOf()` methods be
  implemented as well.

      N¬∫: value: Object.freeze
        major: 0
        minor: 1
        patch: 0
        toString: -> "#{@major}.#{@minor}.#{@patch}"
        valueOf: -> @major * 100 + @minor + @patch / 100

##  How to Read This Source  ##

ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ is written in Literate CoffeeScript; this file is
  actually a part of the ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ source!
If you are new to Literate CoffeeScript, you might be surprised to find
  that the code blocks above are the actual source for those parts of
  the program.
The rest of the source files are structured in a similar way, mixing
  source code with documentation.

For those experienced in CoffeeScript, you might expect each file to be
  wrapped in a closure, with its own local variables.
However, the ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ build procedures stitch the source files
  together _prior_ to compilation.
That means that local variables declared in one file will be made
  available in later ones, but not to the global context as a whole.
See [Roost](https://github.com/marrus-sh/Roost) if you're curious about
  this process.

The style of CoffeeScript used in this source differs pretty
  significantly from what you might encounter elsewhere.
Stick with it, and you'll get the hang of it, and you can always
  [compile to JavaScript](https://coffeescript.org/#try) those parts
  that you do not understand.

##  Don't Be Confused!  ##

As you have probably already noticed, this source uses Unicode
  characters in some variable names.
The global variable, `ÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩíÔΩçÔΩÅÔΩâÔΩÑ`, is written using fullwidth
  characters, and this is _not_ the same name `mermaid`, written using
  proportional (ASCII) ones.

The letter `U+01C0 «Ä LATIN LETTER DENTAL CLICK` is used to "namespace"
  names.
For example, all of the types defined by the XML Schema Definition
  Language specification have JavaScript constructors whose names start
  with `XSD«Ä`.
This is _not_ the same character as `U+007C | VERTICAL LINE`, which
  will always appear in this source surrounded by spaces.

The letter `U+01C3 «É LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK` is used in function
  names to denote a function that either throws an error or returns
  `undefined`.
Frequently, this function is named `test«É`.
This is _not_ the same character as `U+0021 ! EXCLAMATION MARK`, which
  will never appear in this source directly following a variable name.

The letter `U+02D0 ‚Ñô DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL P` is used in local
  variable names for prototypes; `Example‚Ñô` provides the local name for
  `Example.prototype` (in CoffeeScript, `Example::`).
